# JITTAC

This repository builds upon the Jittac tool, it is forked from the sourceforge https://sourceforge.net/projects/actool/

This repository builds a working update site allowing to install the software on modern eclipse (03-21) leveraging maven and Github Actions, which we thank for lending the computation time and bancdwisdth to host the artefacts.

Generated Web page + update site address :
